# About 
This time I'm about to present one of my collections from Postman, which is extremely special to me because it was my first one. <br> 
To find out what the collection is and how it works, jump to the *"Description of the collection"* file. <br>
To run the collection, copy insides of the *Maps API* file and past it in your Postman client (Import > Raw text) or create a json-file on your PC, then fill it with the insides, and add it to the Postman client (Import > File)
